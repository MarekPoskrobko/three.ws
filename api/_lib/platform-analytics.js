// Platform analytics: every headline number three.ws publishes about itself,
// in one read, each with a daily series and a plain-language `method`.
//
// This is the data layer behind GET /api/platform/analytics and the /analytics
// page. It answers "how big is the platform and is it growing" from the real
// tables that record each activity, never from a counter someone typed in.
//
// Contract:
//   - Every metric carries `total` (all time), `window_total` (inside the
//     requested window), a zero-filled `daily` series over the window, and a
//     `method` string saying exactly which rows were counted.
//   - Metrics are read in SOURCES (one or two queries per table). A source that
//     fails or times out yields `null` for each of its metrics plus one entry in
//     `errors`; it never fails the whole read and never reports a zero it did
//     not measure.
//   - Counting predicates match the endpoints that already publish the same
//     figure, so the analytics page and the home page can never disagree:
//     agents use the /api/home-stats and /api/platform/stats predicate, 3D
//     models the /api/home-stats one, marketplace sales the MARKET_PAID_KINDS
//     gate /pulse uses, and hire volume is read through platformEconomyStats(),
//     the helper behind /api/agent-economy/volume.
