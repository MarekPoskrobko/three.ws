// Floating site chrome that follows a visitor across every route and parks
// itself over a corner of the viewport: the corner stack, the discovery card,
// the language switcher, the walk companion, the cookie banner. Each is one of
// our own features, which is exactly why none of them may sit in a frame that
// announces a different one. Framing them out is a crop, not an edit of the
// product surface.
//
// One list, shared by every capture path, so a new piece of chrome is hidden
// everywhere the day it is added here.
